Sprint Review 3 Update – Strategic AS-IS Requirements Completed

For Sprint 3, I have completed the full Strategic AS-IS Process Modelling Requirements for the External Maintenance workflow between ProBuild Supplies Ltd and FixPro Ltd.

This work builds directly on the SD and SR models from Sprints 1 and 2 and follows the assessment constraints for the Strategic BPMN model.

Completed in Sprint 3

Defined the scope of the AS-IS strategic model (included vs out of scope)

Identified all actors and swimlanes required from the case study

Listed high-level AS-IS tasks (kept under 10 as required)

Documented KPIs and for strategic alignment

Specified ≤ 8 artefacts/data objects

Added required decision points (tool classification + repair authorisation)

Applied BPMN 2.0 strategic modelling rules, including message flows

Ensured traceability with SD/SR models from Sprints 1 & 2

Uploaded the full requirements file to GitHub under:
📂 /requirements/SPM_ExternalMaintenance_Requirements.m

Next Steps

The Strategic BPMN model will now be generated based on these requirements.
The full BPMN diagram will be finalised and uploaded for Sprint Review 4.
